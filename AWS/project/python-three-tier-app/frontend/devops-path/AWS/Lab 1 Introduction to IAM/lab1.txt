Lab 1: Introduction to IAM
##########################

Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Explore IAM Users and Groups
- Inspect IAM policies applied to groups
- Follow a real-world scenario that adds users to groups and explores group permissions
- Locate and use the IAM sign-in URL
- Experiment with policies and service access


Task 1: Create IAM users, groups, and policies
----------------------------------------------

In this task, you create IAM users and groups

Create 3 users:
- user1
- user2
- user3

Three groups with the following policies:
- S3 Support: read-only access to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
- EC2 Support: read-only access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
- EC Admin: ability to view, start, and stop EC2 instances

Task 2: Manage users and groups
-------------------------------

In this task, you work with the users and groups, enabling permissions to support a business scenario.

Business scenario
Your companyâ€™s use of Amazon Web Services grows over time. The company uses many Amazon EC2 instances and 
a significant amount of Amazon S3 storage. You want to grant access to new staff members based on their job functions, as shown in the table.

User	Group	    Permissions
user-1	S3-Support	Read-Only access to Amazon S3
user-2	EC2-Support	Read-Only access to Amazon EC2
user-3	EC2-Admin	View, Start, and Stop Amazon EC2 instances

Add user-1 to the S3-Support group
You recently hired user-1 into a role to provide support for Amazon S3. 
You want to add them to the S3-Support group to inherit the necessary permissions in the attached AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess policy.

Add user-2 to the EC2-Support group
You hired user-2 for a role to provide support for Amazon EC2.

Add user-3 to the EC2-Admin group
You hired user-3 as your Amazon EC2 administrator.

Review user and group assignments
Each Group should have a 1 in the Users column to denote the number of users in each group.

If you do not have a 1 beside each group, revisit the preceding instructions to ensure that each user belongs to a group, as shown in the table in the Business Scenario section.
