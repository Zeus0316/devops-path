Lab 2: Creating a VPC and Launching a Web Application in an Amazon EC2 Instance

Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

Create a new Amazon VPC with two public subnets
Create an Internet Gateway
Create a Route Table with a Public Route to the Internet
Create a Security Group
Launch an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance
Configure an EC2 instance to host a web application using a user data script

Scenario
In this scenario, you create the underlying network architecture needed to run a web application on an Amazon EC2 instance. 
After building the network, you launch the EC2 Instance used to host your web application and conduct a simple test to verify you can access it in a web browser.


Task 1: Create a Virtual Private Cloud
In this task, you create a VPC, an Internet gateway, a Route Table with a public route to the Internet, 
and two public subnets in a two separate Availability Zones (AZs).
VPC IPv4 CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16
Subnet 1 IPv4 CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24
Subnet 2 IPv4 CIDR block 10.0.1.0/24

Task 2: Create a VPC Security Group
In this task, you create a VPC security group. A security group controls the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave 
the resources that it is associated with. For example, after you associate a security group with an EC2 instance, it controls 
the inbound and outbound traffic for the instance, similar to a firewall.

Task 3: Launch Your Amazon EC2 Instance
In this task, you create an EC2 instance and provide a bootstrap script to install and configure the requirements for your web application. You also enable SSH (Secure Shell) access to the instance.
Copy the following script and paste it into the User data text box:
#!/bin/bash -ex

# Update yum
yum -y update

# installs nvm (Node Version Manager)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion

# download and install Node.js (you may need to restart the terminal)
nvm install 20

# Create a dedicated directory for the application
mkdir -p /var/app

# Get the app from S3
wget https://aws-tc-largeobjects.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ILT-TF-100-TECESS-5/app/app.zip

# Extract it to the desired folder
unzip app.zip -d /var/app/
cd /var/app/

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the app
npm start

Open a new browser tab and paste the IP address you copied in the previous step. You should see the following application screen.
