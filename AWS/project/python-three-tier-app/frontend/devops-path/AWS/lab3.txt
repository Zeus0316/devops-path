Lab 3: Configure a Web Application to use an Amazon S3 Bucket and Amazon DynamoDB Table

Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

Create an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) Bucket
Create an S3 bucket policy
Modify an Application to Use an S3 Bucket
Upload an Object to an S3 Bucket
Create an Amazon DynamoDB table
Test an Application Using an Application Web Interface
Manage Existing DynamoDB Items Using the AWS Management Console
Create Items in a DynamoDB Table Using the AWS Management Console

Scenario
Your employee directory application launched successfully, but now you must customize the application to include employee 
images and information using Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB. In this lab, you create an Amazon S3 bucket and modify the bucket policy. 
Then, you upload objects (images) to the S3 bucket. Next, you configure the employee directory application to use the S3 Bucket as a data source. 
Next, you will remove objects from the S3 bucket and test the impact on the application. After configuring the application to use Amazon S3, 
you create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Finally, you use the application interface and DynamoDB to create items in your table and test the functionality of the application.
